Toll highways are becoming a popular method of revenue generation for provincial, state, and municipal governments across North America. There are several models of toll highways in North America. In Ontario, Canada, one popular toll highway is the 407ETR. Your task in this assignment is to implement a program that calculates a customer’s toll charges when driving on a fictive toll highway. Please read the requirements of the assignment carefully to make sure you understand all the specifications. A sample output run is provided below to help you.

There are several factors taken into account to calculate toll charges for this particular highway:• Customers are charged a basic highway entrance fee of $1.25 per trip.• There are three travelling zones on the highway:	o Zone 1: from km marker1 0 to marker 30 
	o Zone 2: from km marker 31 to marker 60 
	o Zone 3: from km marker 61 to marker 90• Light vehicles are charged at a rate of 40.85 cents per km. Heavy vehicles are charged at a rate of 81.75 cents per km.• There is surcharge of 27% to travel in Zone 2.• Vehicles without a rental transponder unit are charged an additional camera recordingfee of $4.15.• All applicable Ontario taxes (13%) are added to the total.

To calculate a customer’s toll charges, your main program must do the followings:• Display the instructions• Get data: entry marker; exit marker; vehicle type, and whether the customer has atransponder or not• Calculate the trip charges (total price for the kilometers travelled, taking into account the zone(s) and the vehicle type)• Calculate the total bill amount (includes the entry fee, the trip charges, the charge for a camera free – if applicable – and the taxes)• Display the total amount due
All constants outlined above must be stored in constant variables at the top of your .py file. Hint: There are 12 constants.
